#Kindergarten steps
- [ ] Eli would first find the right data he is trying to target

- [ ] Eli would then dig a little deeper to target the TEAM pile of data and loop through it
- [ ] Once Eli finds the piece of data he needs (PLAYERS) he sets it aside (VAR )to use it later
- [ ] Then Eli would use the PLAYERS Data he set aside and loop through that pile to find Players he needs
- [ ] Then Eli wants to make sure these are the right players he needs and prints it out to be sure
- [ ] Once Eli confirms the data he now wants to print it out to the screen.
- [ ] Eli creates space on the screen so the data can fit
- [ ] Then Eli appends the data the space he allocated for the screen
- [ ] Then Eli pushes all of the data he set up into the container he initially set up
- [ ] Eli checks to see if he left any data and return it if he did
- [ ] Finally Eli pushes the container data to the screen
